//
// Derives a short "Format: e.g. ..." hint from an authored accept[] value, so a learner sees the
// SHAPE of an expected answer without ever seeing the real one. Every placeholder below is a
// fixed constant, never derived from the real answer's magnitude — the only real information ever
// reflected back is a structural fact (which variable letter is used, whether a $ sign or a colon
// belongs), never a number that could coincide with the actual answer.
//
// This file is the Node/build-time copy, used by generate-book.mjs for the 18 static topics (whose
// accept[] is known at build time). js/quiz-engine.js carries a second, ES5 copy of the same two
// functions for the 6 dynamic topics (whose accept[] is only known at runtime, after the seeded
// generator has run) — see tests/format-hint.test.mjs, which checks the two copies agree on a
// shared fixture list so they can't silently drift apart.

// Parses a SIMPLE linear expression "±A·letter ±B" (degree ≤ 1, one variable) into
// {coeff, cons, letter}, or null if the string isn't shaped like one. Kept in lock-step with the
// identically-named function in js/topic-interactions.js (same algorithm, verified by the shared
// fixture test) — deliberately not a full CAS, see that file's comment for the exact scope.
